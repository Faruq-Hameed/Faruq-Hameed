## Hi, I am Faruq Hameed.
# Software Engineer | Backend Developer | Mobile and Web Dev

I’m an intermediate Fullstack Developer with 4 years of professional experience across fintech, edtech, and high-growth startups. I specialize in backend engineering and mobile development, delivering secure, scalable software across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

On the backend, I build reliable and high-performance APIs using Node.js, Express, NestJS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, with strong focus on clean architecture, testing, and optimization. I’m fast and dependable when it comes to developing backend systems that power production applications.

Over the past 2 years, I’ve also developed hands-on experience in mobile development, creating production-grade apps using React Native, Expo, and Context API. I work closely with designers via Figma to ship smooth, cross-platform user experiences.

I’m passionate about writing quality code, improving development workflows, and contributing meaningfully to team success. I’m open to remote and relocation opportunities within or outside Nigeria.
