# üî≠ Projects
For all projects listed here, I only worked on the server side but with the intention of writing the frontend codes as my knowledge of the stack (MERN) widens. The projects are;
- üè´ Citrone :  Citrone is an innovative web application designed to empower educators in creating captivating learning experiences for students. Leveraging technologies such as Express, MongoDB, and Passport, I contributed to the backend implementation, enabling essential functionalities like user authentication and password reset. The application offers user routes for seamless user profile management and incorporates authenticated routes, accessible solely by the admin, to facilitate course and module administration. As a valued member of the backend team, my contributions significantly contributed to the successful development of Citrone, effectively showcasing my expertise in full-stack web development and RESTful API design. This live project stands as a testament to my collaborative skills and proficiency in delivering impactful educational solutions.

- üìü E-connect: This is an instant messaging web application. Users can send and recieve messages from there friends and perform all CRUD operations in the all routes. Also authentication was done to ensure that users must accept a friend request before chating the other user. The project is still an ongoing project but most CRUD operations can be successfully carried on by users. **[Github Repository URl For This Project](https://github.com/Faruq-Hameed/vid_project))**
  
- üé• Vid app: VID APP is a feature-rich movie rental web application with a skillfully implemented backend. It efficiently manages data through CRUD operations for genres, movies, customers, and rentals. Secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens protects specific routes. The backend's pagination optimizes data retrieval for large datasets. Utilizing MongoDB and Mongoose enhances efficiency and scalability. VID APP showcases my proficiency in backend web development, utilizing Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to deliver a comprehensive and impressive project. **[Github Repository URl For This Project](https://github.com/Faruq-Hameed/vid_project))**

- üóØÔ∏è Simple blogging: The "Blogging App" project is a robust blogging web application with a powerful backend, leveraging Express and MongoDB in developing the RESTful APIs. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete blogs, comments, and user accounts. The application supports search queries for users based on email and username, with pagination for retrieving limited data. Additionally, the backend ensures seamless access to user-specific information and posts.. **[Github repository URl](https://github.com/Faruq-Hameed/simple_blogging)**

- üöê E-commerce website : I'm currently working on this server side of this E-commerce website. The Users and Admins can perdorm various CRUD operations based on different authentication and authorization.  **[Vercel deployment URL](https://faruq-e-commerce.vercel.app/)**
